# Quake Report

This Android application uses the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program API to provide users with real-time information about earthquakes around the world.

This app demonstrates the following views and techniques:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make api calls to an HTTP web service
* [RxJava3](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) for multithreading
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk) to display earthquake locations on map

It leverages the following components from the Jetpack library:

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) with binding adapters
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments
